# Sweetroll

> ⚠️ This library is as alpha as alpha gets. Please exercise extreme caution when using this code as there are still plentiful reworks and optimizations to be made, as well as features to be added.

### Installation:
```shell
npm i @jacoblockett/sweetroll
```

Documentation is coming soon. The gist until then is that there are currently 3 wrappers - one for arrays, another for object literals, and finally one for strings. The array wrapper is the most complete of the bunch, containing all of the functionality of the native Array objects. Strings are being actively developed and the Object literal wrapper has a proof function, but nothing more. More wrappers are planned than these, but this is what exists so far. All wrapper methods have JSDocs, so documentation can be gleamed from that in the meantime.
